# Video 3: What is AsyncAPI
 
Hello everyone! Welcome back!

My name is ...  This video will help you understand what AsyncAPI is and how to continue learning about this Open-Source project. 

In this video, we'll talk about:

 - What is AsyncAPI Spec, and how did it come about
 - What AsyncAPI brings
 - What is AsyncAPI Initiative, and what are its objectives
 - The relation between AsyncAPI and Linux Foundation

 Ready? Let's get started!

## What is AsyncAPI Spec, and how did it come about

AsyncAPI is an open-source specification founded by Fran Mendez in 2017. Inspired by OpenAPI, it aims at making working with EDA as easy as working with REST APIs. But, how to do that?

The Spec describes and documents message-driven APIs in a machine-readable format. It's protocol-agnostic, so you can use it for APIs that work over AMQP, MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, STOMP, HTTP, etc.

It defines a set of files required to describe an API. These files can then be used to create utilities, such as documentation, integration and/or testing tools.

The AsyncAPI Specification doesn't assume any kind of software topology, architecture or pattern. Therefore, a server may be a message broker, a web server or any other kind of computer program capable of sending and/or receiving data. However, AsyncAPI offers a mechanism called "bindings". Those are the means of transmitting messages from a Service Component Architecture component to a web service and vice versa. They aims to help with more specific information about the protocol and/or the topology. The AsyncAPI specification settles the base for a greater and better tooling ecosystem for EDA's.

## What AsyncAPI brings

Its main contribution to the world of APIs is the standardization and simplification of the methods to describe and design EDAs.

We could even say that AsyncAPI is a specification that facilitates and simplifies working with APIs,speeding up the work of developers. Having defined, documented, and accepted the communication between APIs, AsyncAPI provides an increased and more efficient information control.

AsyncAPI Initiative also develops and maintains an extensive amount of AsyncAPI tools that accelerate application development. The tools' mechanisms for automating complex and essential tasks facilitate code generation, documentation generation, validators, etc. 

AsyncAPI specification is maintained under the AsyncAPI Initiative.

## What is AsyncAPI Initiative, and what are its objectives

The AsyncAPI Initiative is a community that not only maintains the specification. The goal of the initiative is to provide proper tooling support for the spec that goes from documentation to code generation and from discovery to event management.

AsyncAPI Initiative currently aims at accomplishing three main goals:

1. Reuse other specifications. You can change to most developers complement the event architecture with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, or Avro and CloudEvents, embracing reusability.

2. Make the development experience super seamless, from idea to production. Users should be able to create their first API in a matter of minutes without prior knowledge of AsyncAPI.

3. Be one of the most popular API spec. As a community-driven project run under open governance, AsyncAPI needs a constantly growing community taking care of it.

## The relation between AsyncAPI and Linux Foundation

An important step to AsyncAPI initiative consolidation was to partner with Postman at the end of 2020. Thanks to this partnership, a dedicated department works full-time on the AsyncAPI spec, its tools, and community-building aspects.

The strategy is to continue implementing and improving the resources that make AsyncAPI more complete and solid. An agreement to host AsyncAPI under a neutral foundation like Linux, guarantees the long-term sustainability and success of the project.

## Goodbye to the viewer

We hope you enjoyed hearing about the origin of AsyncAPI and what it brings. The next video will highlight the similarities and differences between AsyncAPI and OpenAPI.

Thank you for watching!
