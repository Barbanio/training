# Video 3: What is AsyncAPI? 
 
Hello everyone! Welcome!
		
This video will help you understand what AsyncAPI is and how to continue learning about this Open-Source project. 

In this video, we'll talk about:
 - What is AsyncAPI?
 - How did AsyncAPI come about?
 - What AsyncAPI brings 
 - How AsyncAPI Works
 
 Ready? Let's get started!

## Definition of AsyncAPI

AsyncAPI is an open-source specification that aims to make working with EDA as easy as it is to work with REST APIs today.

The strategy is to continue improving, implementing resources that make it more complete and solid. This has led to an agreement of joinment between AsyncAPI Initiative and the Linux Foundation last year. As a result AsyncAPI Initiative is fostered and hosted by a neutral foundation that guarantees the long-term sustainability and success of the project. 

Another important step the initiative took towards its consolidation was to partner with Postman at the end of 2020, a leading collaborative platform developing APIs. This partnership allows investment in a dedicated department working full time on AsyncAPI spec, tools and community-building aspects.

AsyncAPI Initiative currently aims to accomplish three main goals:

1. Unify all API specifications. No one does event-driven architecture alone. Most developers complement the event architecture with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, and RPC APIs. Let us embrace reusability!

2. Make the development experience super seamless, from idea to production. Users should be able to create their first API in a matter of minutes without prior knowledge of AsyncAPI.

3. Reach the first position among the most used API specifications. This will require a growth in the number of community members by ensuring it is a community-driven project running under open governance.

 ## How did it come about?
Founded by Fran Mendez, AsyncAPI started as a side project at Hitch (API Changelog). He identified a lack of tools in the message-driven space and searched for a solution for standardized message-driven specification systems. 

 ## What AsyncAPI brings
AsyncAPI is an extensible and protocol-agnostic specification that helps with asynchronous APIs. Its main contribution to the world of APIs is the standardization of how you can design and describe Event-Driven Architectures in a simplified and unified manner.

Having defined, documented, and accepted the communication between APIs provides increased and efficient information control.

AsyncAPI initiative also develops and maintains an extensive amount of AsyncAPI tools that accelerate application development. The tools' mechanisms for automating complex and essential tasks facilitate code generation, documentation generation, validators, etc. We could even say that AsyncAPI is a specification that facilitates, simplifies, and accelerates the work of developers working with APIs. 




## Goodbye to the viewer
We hope you enjoyed hearing about the origin of AsyncAPI and what it brings. The next video will highlight the similarities and differences between AsyncAPI and OpenAPI.

Thank you for joining us today!
