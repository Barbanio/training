# Video 3: What is AsyncAPI
 
Hello everyone! Welcome!
		
This video will help you understand what AsyncAPI is and how to continue learning about this Open-Source project. 

In this video, we'll talk about:

 - What is AsyncAPI Spec and how did it come about
 - What AsyncAPI brings
 - What is AsyncAPI Initiative and what are its objectives
 - AsyncAPI foundations 

 Ready? Let's get started!

## What is AsyncAPI Spec and how did it come about

AsyncAPI is an open-source specification founded by Fran Mendez, that aims to make working with EDA as easy as it's to work with REST APIs today. But, how to do that?

The Spec is used to describe and document message-driven APIs in a machine-readable format. Itâ€™s protocol-agnostic, so you can use it for APIs that work over any protocol (e.g., AMQP, MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, STOMP, HTTP, etc).

It defines a set of files required to describe an API. These files can then be used to create utilities, such as documentation, integration and/or testing tools.

The AsyncAPI Specification doesn't assume any kind of software topology, architecture or pattern. Therefore, a server MAY be a message broker, a web server or any other kind of computer program capable of sending and/or receiving data. However, AsyncAPI offers a mechanism called "bindings" that aims to help with more specific information about the protocol and/or the topology.

## What AsyncAPI brings

Its main contribution to the world of APIs is the standardization of how you can design and describe Event-Driven Architectures in a simplified and unified manner.

We could even say that AsyncAPI is a specification that facilitates, simplifies, and accelerates the work of developers working with APIs. Having defined, documented, and accepted the communication between APIs, AsyncAPI provides an increased and more efficient information control.

AsyncAPI Initiative also develops and maintains an extensive amount of AsyncAPI tools that accelerate application development. The tools' mechanisms for automating complex and essential tasks facilitate code generation, documentation generation, validators, etc. 

AsyncAPI specification is maintained under AsyncAPI Initiative.

## What is AsyncAPI Initiative and what are its objectives

AsyncAPI Initiative is a community that not only maintains the specification. Goal of the initiative is to provide proper tooling support for the spec. That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management.

AsyncAPI Initiative currently aims to accomplish three main goals:

1. Reuse other specifications. Most developers complement the event architecture with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, and RPC APIs. Let us embrace reusability! you can change to Most developers complement the event architecture with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, or Avro and CloudEvents. Let us embrace reusability!

2. Make the development experience super seamless, from idea to production. Users should be able to create their first API in a matter of minutes without prior knowledge of AsyncAPI.

3. Reach the first position among the most used API specifications. This will require a growth in the number of community members by ensuring it is a community-driven project running under open governance.

## AsyncAPI joins Linux Foundation

An important step the initiative took towards its consolidation was to partner with Postman at the end of 2020. This partnership allows investment in a dedicated department working full time on AsyncAPI spec, tools and community-building aspects.

The strategy is to continue improving, implementing resources that make it more complete and solid. This has led to an agreement of joinment between AsyncAPI Initiative and the Linux Foundation in 2021. As a result AsyncAPI Initiative is fostered and hosted by a neutral foundation that guarantees the long-term sustainability and success of the project. 

## Goodbye to the viewer

We hope you enjoyed hearing about the origin of AsyncAPI and what it brings. The next video will highlight the similarities and differences between AsyncAPI and OpenAPI.

Thank you for watching!
