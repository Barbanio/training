# Video 3: What is AsyncAPI? 
 
Hello everyone! Welcome!
		
This video will help you understand what AsyncAPI is and how to continue learning about this Open-Source project. 

In this video, we'll talk about:
 - What is AsyncAPI?
 - How did AsyncAPI come about?
 - What AsyncAPI brings 
 - How AsyncAPI Works
 
 Ready? Let's get started!

## Definition of AsyncAPI

AsyncAPI is an open-source specification that aims to make working with EDA as easy as it is to work with REST APIs today.

The strategy is to continue improving, implementing resources that make it more complete and solid. This has led to the recent merger with the Linux Foundation last year. Hosting the project on a neutral foundation guarantees the long-term sustainability and success of the initiative. 

Another important step the initiative took towards its consolidation was to partner with Postman at the end of 2020, a leading collaborative platform developing APIs and a reference in the sector worldwide. This partnership allows it to drive the growth of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain asynchronous APIs while using their usual languages and working environments.

AsyncAPI currently aims to accomplish three main goals:

1. Unify all API specifications. No one does event-driven architecture alone. Most developers complement the event architecture with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, and RPC APIs.

2. Improve the performance of the specification to make it more and more seamless. Users should be able to create their first API in a matter of minutes without prior knowledge of AsyncAPI.

3. Reach the first position among the most used API specifications. This will require a growth in the number of community members of around 400% over the next two years.

 ## How did it come about?
Founded by Fran Mendez, AsyncAPI started as a side project at Hitch (API Changelog). The AsyncAPI developers identified a lack of tools in the message-driven space and searched for a solution for standardized message-driven specification systems. 
 
They formulated an "API theory," so to speak, with as many interactive API types as RESTful web services, GraphQL, and message-based architectures. AsyncAPI wanted to serve as a common unifying language for the various formats, protocols, and specifications. All of the above resulted in creating standardized communication in message-based systems. 

 ## What AsyncAPI brings
 AsyncAPI is an extensible and agnostic communication protocol specification that helps in message-based cases. AsyncAPI's main contribution to the world of APIs is the standardization of communication between APIs by making messages (events) more machine-readable. This approach allows developers to implement it in a simplified manner.  

Having defined, documented, and accepted the communication between APIs provides increased and efficient information control. It is a multichannel tool that currently supports existing protocols.

We also have an extensive amount of AsyncAPI tools that accelerate application development. The tools' mechanisms for automating complex and essential tasks facilitate code generation, documentation generation, validators, etc. We could even say that this is a specification that facilitates, simplifies, and accelerates the work of developers working with APIs.
