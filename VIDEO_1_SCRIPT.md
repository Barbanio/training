Hello! Hello! My name is …, I work as ... in (company)... and today I'm going to talk about APIs. I'm sure you've heard about APIs more than once. They're everywhere! On the net, apps, and almost all the technology we use in our everyday lives. 

We're going to dive a little bit into their history and origins, explaining what they are, what types of APIs exist, and what are their benefits. Finally, we will show you some API examples to make the concept and its use clearer.

Let’s go!

## What are APIs

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. APIs are a tool that facilitates the communication and relationship between two applications. It’s the way two machines are able to exchange messages or data and understand each other. 

APIs allow your products and services to communicate with others, without needing to know how they are implemented. An API is a set of definitions and protocols used to develop and integrate application software.

For communicating we need to be on the same page; it's the same for machines. You see, API is a user interface that enables interaction and communication between software and a person.

Each API is designed in a particular programming language and with distinct specifications that define it. APIs may include specifications for data structures, routines, object classes, or variables; all based on your selected interface.  

It's easier for each API to have complete and effective documentation, such as a set of tutorials, manuals, and best practices for that programming interface.

APIs are an essential part of the development process of any application, but it remains hidden from the end-user. They are the great unknowns. The magic trick that makes things work!

## Brief history of APIs

Have you ever wondered when and how APIs were born? Did you know that APIs are not that old? The API story took baby steps until around the beginning of the new millennium. That's when APIs began growing fast until they became a fundamental piece of the digital world where we live today. 

But, not that fast! Let’s go back to their roots: The cloud computing company Salesforce made the Internet the medium in which its service would live, based from its origins on an API. 

However, the official arrival and introduction to the public of APIs took place with the dissertation written by Roy Fielding, one of the main authors of the HTTP specification and creator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. That was a fundamental step to understanding the childhood adventures and quick growth of APIs. Their adventures, misfortunes, and dreams. Their initial history, after all.

Beyond emotions, the beginning of APIs took solid steps with a certain constancy thanks to e-commerce. At the end of 2000, eBay launched its API together with a program that, trying to boost the area of e-commerce solutions, also encouraged APIs in the process. Moreover, eBay was not alone in this endeavor: in the summer of 2002, the giant Amazon followed suit.

Amazon put the icing on the cake with the launch of Amazon Web Services. With this platform, the company enabled developers to incorporate Amazon content and features into their own web pages, making it possible for third-party sites to search for and display the company's products.

Social networks were the next springboard where APIs gain momentum: in fact, a few months after its launch in 2004, Flickr made its platform available to developers. And that was one of the secrets of its quick success. Yahoo took over the social network when Flickr's REST API quickly made it the preferred photo platform for many bloggers who could easily integrate their images into their websites.

Flickr was then ahead of its time, as it was not until two years later, in September 2006, that Facebook opened its platform for developers and its first API, which allowed access to the list of Facebook friends, photos, events, and profile information. A mine of endless information. Just a month later, Twitter joined the game.

And while the social platforms were experimenting in the promising world of APIs, Google was going one step further and preparing the way to integrate its tools into third-party sites: just six months after the launch of Google Maps, the Mountain View company launched the mapping service API. They did so in response to the countless fake platforms that emerged based on hacking information from Google's tool.

After the success of its first attempt, Amazon took its APIs to the next level. Far from focusing exclusively on e-commerce, the company opted to create an entire infrastructure to support developers based on REST APIs: first with Amazon S3, to store data in the cloud, and later with Amazon EC2, to provision virtual servers in their data centers.

Since 2010, the prevalence of the public API has skyrocketed. Smartphones finally brought APIs to our daily lives, every day, every hour, making life easier for every user that was coming and going. We now had support in understanding the world with the help of machines that communicated with each other fluently. All this information is within grasp to men and women, merely one-click away. 

E-commerce, Social media, cloud computing, mobility… Without a doubt, we are definitely living in the Web API era.

## Types of APIs

There are 4 types of APIs: 

- **Web services APIs**: these are the application development interfaces that enable the exchange of information between an application and a web service. (A web service is a software that provides access to a particular service via a URL). 

    There are four types of Web services APIs:

    •	SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), a standard protocol for exchanging information and data in XML between two objects.

    •	XML-RPC, a remote procedure call protocol that uses XML as the data format and HTTP calls as the communication system.

    •	JSON-RPC, same as XML-RPC but in JSON format. 

    •	REST (Representational State Transfer), a software architecture for hypermedia systems on the World Wide Web; a REST API often uses the HTTP protocol.

- **Library-based APIs**: these types of APIs are those that allow an application to import a library from other software, in order to exchange information. Nowadays, many of the libraries that provide access to products and services are designed in JavaScript.

- **Class-based APIs**: this type of application development interface allows the connection with data around classes, as is usual in object-oriented programming with Java. The Java API uses abstract classes for the creation of applications just like any program developed in this language. These classes provide everything needed to perform all kinds of functions within these applications. The Java development interface is organized into packages and each of those packages, in turn, contains a set of related classes.  

- **Function APIs in operating systems**: software programs are continuously interacting with operating systems (OS). In many cases, the way they do so is through APIs. Operating systems such as Windows have APIs that enable such communication between programs and the OS.

## Benefits of APIs

Let's highlight the many benefits of APIs:

- **Adaptation**: needs change over time and APIs help anticipate changes. When working on this technology, data migration can be better supported, while offering a better review of the information. 

- **Automation**: APIs allow IT teams rather than people to do the work. Through APIs, workflows can be updated so that they can be done in less time while being more productive.

- **Application**: enabling API access to app components provides flexibility in the delivery of services and information.  

- **Customization**: through APIs, any user can customize content and services.

- **Efficiency**: when access to an API is provided, the content that is generated can be automatically published and made available to all channels. It allows it to be shared and distributed more easily. 

- **Integration**: APIs allow content to be more easily embedded from any site or application. This ensures seamless information delivery and an integrated user experience.

## Example of an API

I think it would be great to give some example of API related to AsyncAPI, any idea or suggestion?

## Goodbye to viewer

I hope that the idea of what an API is and its environment are clearer now to you. It’s good to know what was the long, winding road and previous efforts made before a tool is implemented.
