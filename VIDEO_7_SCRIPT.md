Hello everybody! I hope that you’re doing well. Welcome once more to the AsyncAPI video, where we explain the project and its progress. Today we’ll talk about the AsyncAPI community.

## Definition of community

The sharing of a language, customs, geographic location, tastes, currents of thought, etc., are the foundations where communication and understanding can be found. However, a community is more than a mere group of human beings linked by common characteristics or interests. A community is united by goals projected to the future, hoping to build something valuable.

But, nowadays is not necessary to share the same time and space to create a group of people committed to working on a project. Today the number of virtual communities is growing exponentially, letting people from all over the world exchange knowledge and ideas. The only thing to get is space and time to put those on the table, whether a web page or a social network.

We can define five main characteristics of virtual communities: 

- It allows communication between users, either synchronously or asynchronously, without considering time or space.

- The information that can be exchanged is in different formats, including images, videos, documents, audios ...

- They’re formed by a group of users interested in a common topic.

- Large or small groups of users can be created to work on a specific project using different technological tools.

- They promote meaningful, collaborative, and team-based learning.

Virtual communities have become standardized and are part of our daily lives. A large part of their success is to achieve a sense of belonging. Human beings need to be assured of belonging to something to work as a team and feel part of something. 

In addition to generating a sense of belonging, communities facilitate the exchange of information, knowledge, and experiences, contributing to their members' personal and professional development.

## AsyncAPI and its community

As mentioned in previous videos, AsyncAPI is a specification managed and driven by its community. It’s a virtual community open to everyone who participates in the specification. Everyone is welcome. AsyncAPI aspires to form a community with the most accurate possible reflection of society, so diversity and inclusiveness are essential pillars.

Being a virtual community comprises many people from a different world where other races, ethnicities, and cultures converge. As the community grows exponentially, it’s increasingly broad and diverse.

It’s mainly made up of developers at a professional level, but it’s open to receiving all kinds of professionals who can contribute or collaborate with the project. Everyone has something to contribute. Not only are all ideas, opinions, inputs, or contributions welcome, but all constructive criticism is taken into account to continue growing and improving.

AsyncAPI intends that everyone who arrives feels welcome, respected, and included in any project proposal, idea, or decision-making. It’s intended that the people who make up the community feel that the project is part of them, generating a sense of belonging.

## How to work in a community

As we already know, AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative. It’s a free project whose goal is to be formed by all the people who want to be part of it. It follows the basic idea of being created by all and for all. 

AsyncAPI community is spread between different platforms such as Slack, GitHub, and the main social networks of the project, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Youtube.

Communication and work are usually done asynchronously. However, there are regular meetings that are open to all people who want to discuss and analyze issues related to the project live. There’re currently four types of meetings:

- **SIG Meetings**: This is the AsyncAPI Special Interest Group meeting. The meeting takes place on alternate Tuesdays. Anyone interested can join through Zoom. Recordings from the previous sessions are available in this playlist on YouTube.

- **Contributor First**: meetings dedicated to contributors that want to learn more about ways to contribute to AsyncAPI. We explain where and how to start. We share tips and tricks. 

- **Spec 3.0 Meetings**: these are oriented to the community members participating in constructing the 3.0 version of the AsyncAPI specification. The meeting takes place every two weeks, on Wednesdays. The first and third week of each month until the release. Recordings of previous meetings are available on Youtube.

- **Design Meetings**: a space dedicated to discussing design in AsyncAPI. They’re held one Thursday a month at 16:00 UTC. These meetings cover a wide variety of topics within the product design space: visual design (design system, user interface kit), user experience through tools, user research...

The main communication channel in which the community moves is through Slack. In this platform, ideas are presented, debates are held, and the steps taken in the initiative are reported. In GitHub, we work collaboratively and open discussions leaving all the information out in the open to preserve the value of transparency.

It’s built through sharing and teamwork to enrich ourselves through collaborative learning. There’re no direct rules, but the project's code of conduct must be respected. This code is nothing more than a set of rules to follow when interacting and participating in the community, conditions based on common sense to ensure respect and good functioning within the community.

## How to join the community

If you’re not yet part of our community, we’re looking forward to it. We invite you to participate and enjoy yourself with us.
