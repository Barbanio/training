# Video 5: Open Governance
Hello everyone! Thank you for joining us in today's video. Today, we will talk about Open Governance and why AsyncAPI is committed to this model. 

Let's get started!

## What is Open Governance
Open Governance is a model of management based on transparency, collaboration, and ethics which results in clearer accountability and management. Driven by the participation of all the people that make up a project, company, or institution, it promotes a democratic system with inclusive growth.

Open source has become an essential model for the success of open government initiatives. Both share many of the same premises. Developers share information, ideas, and code to create more innovative software solutions, collectively and individually. This scalable and flexible software allows anyone with the source code to modify, improve, and redistribute it for greater accessibility and reuse. Open-source software works with peer-to-peer production and mass collaboration principles, creating a more sustainable software development process for end-users. 

The sharing of ideas and community-developed software has driven creative, scientific, and technological advancement in many industries: education, government, law, health, technology, and more. This movement creates an opportunity for community members to collaborate, share, build, and help each other achieve common goals. In this case, through source code.

## Why AsyncAPI is committed to this model

AsyncAPI is committed to democratic management based on two vertebral aes: horizontality in decision making and transparency in project management. From the beginning of the specification, AsyncAPI is determined to rely on collective effort and group identity. The project focus on a governance and decision-making system in which values come first. The means are as necessary as the goal. Responsibilities are shared, understanding that success can only be enjoyed jointly.

Horizontality is crucial, advocating for creating, developing, and maintaining a fair social structure and the equitable distribution of management and power. This value allows us to be flexible, adaptable, and resilient. 

This type of governance enables us to work with like-minded people living thousands of miles away to pursue and construct a common end goal. The intention is to break down individualism and the hierarchical archetype and uphold a system that gives autonomy and decision-making power to its members. There are essential values such as transparency, equity, and efficiency for this model to work.

Itâ€™s a system of governance and decision-making based on collectivism. Each team member has a voice that should be listened to. After all, no one knows their work better than they know themselves, so, within this model, each person corrects themselves and adapts their work according to the needs of the common goal. Each member is their boss, decentralizing power and transferring it to each team member.

Therefore, we can say that AsyncAPI adopts this type of governance model because it believes in a collective effort based on cooperation, integration, and inclusion of all of its members. Like this, the specification is safeguarded from private interests.

## AsyncAPI and Linux Foundation

Since 2020, when the project started to grow exponentially and impacted the API world significantly, discussions began on the best way to improve open governance. If one thing was unanimously clear, it was that AsyncAPI should join a neutral home. But not just any neutral home. It needed to join a solid, established, and trusted organization. 

Housing the project on the neutral ground would defend and develop its independence and community governance. The objective was to enhance team awareness and a sense of belonging.

AsyncAPI's desire to democratize power and establish a horizontal model is based on the conviction that multiple points of view enrich the vision and decision-making. It improves perspective and knowledge and multiplies the support points to overcome obstacles.

So, with these ideas and principles very clear, after a long time of searches and negotiations, in March 2021, AsyncAPI was housed under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, granting neutrality and ensuring that the specification will continue to be driven by the people who contribute with their time and effort to the project community.
